# Agenda:

Under the Chicago Energy Benchmarking Ordinance, the City reports annually on energy findings and trends, and the ordinance authorizes the City to share building-specific data with the public. Energy benchmarking continues to provide the foundation for increasing energy aptitude, saving energy, reducing utility costs, and supporting clean energy jobs throughout the City.

To support the efforts of the city, We are building a model that predicts the Energy Rating for the building based on its usage over the years 2018-20 which might help the goverments to plan the budgets for energy rebates and take measures to ensure poorely performing stakeholders perform better in future.
